PWEB
============

/!\ WARNING
============
This is a hobby project. Use it at your own risks!

This CMS may be highly vulnerable to SQL injection, beware!

If you fear this may endanger your data, wait for version 0.2.0 which is currently on tracks. It will use a lightweight SQL framework (medoo) which should prevent SQL injection. It will also feature a homemade templating system which will allow easier personalisation and a very simple plugins system to add functionalities.
I'm also considering creating a new dev-branch based on CodeIgniter framework which is known to be quite secure.

NOTE
============
pweb is known to work with the current PHP, MySQL version.

PHP: 	5.6.17

MySQL: 	5.5.44

Most probably, PHP>=5 and MySQL>=5 is required to run pweb.

ADMIN
============
Default admin credentials:

* username: admin
* password: admin

To access the admin board: http://mydomain.com/adm/

Do not forget the last slash "/" otherwise, if your set url rewriting as in "install/url_rewriting.txt", it will try to redirect to http://mydomain.com/pub/adm.php

INSTALLATION
============
To install pweb, make sure you have root access to a MySQL database.

* create a new database;
* execute "install/db.sql" to fill this new database with the required tables;
* upload pweb source code to your webserver root directory;
* read "install/error_pages.txt" and "install/url_rewriting.txt" to set up the error pages and url rewriting accordingly (visit the official pweb website to learn how to do it if you use nginx, should be easier with apache btw.);
* delete the "install" directory from your server;
* change rights (777) to the directories (archives;publis;slides) in assets/ folder;
* access the admin board and change the username and password (this is CAPITAL since anyone could be reading this doc);
* Enjoy!
